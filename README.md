## How It Works

1. **Input**: The user provides a natural language command (e.g., "Who knows JavaScript?").
2. **Processing**: The workflow parses the command, queries the Google Sheets spreadsheet, and retrieves the relevant data.
3. **Output**: The workflow responds with the requested information or confirms the update made to the spreadsheet.
